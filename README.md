# ReceiptBot
This IOS Mobile app will allow users to take photos of receipts and will use OCR(optical character recognition) to extract text inside a single receipt to text format. It implements Google Vision, a machine learning API to identify the amount of money you spend by analyzing each receipt and keeps records. It also provides the option to let users correct numbers or input information manually for people who like the accountability of entering transactions by hand. It will also generate weekly/monthly spending analysis for each user and will give insights to users how they have spent their moeny.
